### AP setup fails with non-alphanumeric passwords

Some devices ship with firmware that cannot connect to WLANs with non-alphanumeric passwords. To fix this, update the firmware to the latest version. You can also change the password to one with just letters and numbers or create a separate guest network with a simpler password.
