WiFi Connectivity
-----------------

- Some devices ship with firmware that cannot connect to WiFi with non-alphnumeric passwords. To work around this, change your WiFi password to one with just letters and numbers, or create a separate guest network with a simpler password. Once the firmware is updated, the device should be able to connect with a normal secure password.
